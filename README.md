# Core

# Modern Data Visualisation Tool (Modav)

## Description

This is a personal learning project aimed at creating a simple, intuitive, and modern data visualization tool using Rust. 

The tool is designed to enable users to effortlessly explore and present their data in various visual forms.

The project is split into 2 parts. The core functionality and the GUI application. This repository is for core functionality. The GUI repo can be found [here](https://github.com/EmmanuelDodoo/modav).

## Planned Features/Goals

I plan to support the most common dataset operations, models and data formats. Iâ€™ve thus grouped the planned features accordingly.

### Supported File Formats

- CSV  and CSV-like data (like TSV)
- JSON
- Excel/Spreadsheet Files

### Visualisation Models

- Line Charts

- Tables

- Bar graphs

- Stacked Bar graphs

- Tree graphs

## Further Documentation

Various sections of the code have dedicated documentation.
